This project was the first website I created for my mother's small business.

It started as me learning HTML and CSS, but soon I was forced to learn Javascript for more intricate animations and buttons.

After some years of programming and only coming back to this project for small changes, I found it tedious to work with the source code of this website. There were many mistakes from me being new to website creation that I wanted to fix and I was annoyed by changing the same thing in multiple places. Because of this, I decided to rewrite everything from scratch in a framework. I chose Next.js for the task and learned React.

However I was not happy with this, as I thought it was overkill for a static site and only resulted in slower load times. Therefore I decided to migrate to Astro which exactly fit my use case.
